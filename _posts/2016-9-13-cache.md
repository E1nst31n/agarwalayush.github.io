title: Cache Side-channeling attacks

Side-channeling attacks are basically some type of attacks which take advantage of the actual implementation of the algorithm rather than using any brute force approach or discovering its theoretical discrepancy.

## What channel can one use?

Its open ended. Anyone can come up with a new channel(way) to extract information, but it is highly dependent on the information you are trying to extract. For example:

### Determining roll no. of a student from university database:

Suppose you have a university website(php based) which tells you whether a student exists in its database or not by entering its name. Website runs a mysql server in the backend to search for the name. So in the php script of the website it will have the query like: 

{% highlight sql %}
Select * from DBTable where name=NAME
{% endhighlight %}

What one can do is instead of entering name like say "alice", you can enter 

{% highlight sql %}
alice' AND CAST(rollno as CHAR) LIKE `1%` and name='a%`
{% endhighlight %}

`CAST` is used to convert int to char so that we can apply substring match on it. Basically what we are trying to do here is the brute force approach in the sense that if the first digit of `rollno` is 1 the query will be `true` and the website will say yes and vice-versa. We can simply run a loop in any scripting language to try out every possible number and infer based on true and false.
So now the complete query becomes:

{% highlight sql %}
Select * from DBTablee where name="alice" AND CAST(rollno as CHAR) LIKE `1%` and name="a%"`
{% endhighlight %}

The ending `name="a%"` is added just to satisfy the last quote, otherwise the query would have been syntastically invalid. 
I admit that this example should be a part of sql injection but I just wanted to emphasize on the fact that the information can be extracted out of some non straight forward side channel.
